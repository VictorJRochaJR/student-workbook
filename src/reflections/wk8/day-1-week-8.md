# What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
It helps showcase your skills and projects and applications you've finished. Helps you show them off

# What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
Having a few good projects that you could show off tailored to the employer

# What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
I would include my Inspire project, Bug Log and Kanban because they show that I now know vanilla javascript, vue and node.js
