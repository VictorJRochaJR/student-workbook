# What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
-It can give you a better idea and a clearer mind on what you really need  and give you  a better starting point.
# How do you find answers when you are stuck?
-You can take a break and clear your mind, not get frustrated. Look online or even ask for help.
# From the entire article what are your biggest takeaway
-That you should test often and work in small parts at a time, you shouldnt use too many global variables.
That criticism is good and to use it as a learning experience.
