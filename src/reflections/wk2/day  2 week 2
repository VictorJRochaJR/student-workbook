What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?
function name(parameters) {
    // statements
}. Being written that way lets the function be hoisted and used before it was defined.
let name = function(parameters) {
    // statements
    The third is 
    let name = (parameters) => {
    // statements
} This one doesnt create its own value
} Wont let you use it before it was defined


What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

Parameters you put in the parantheses in the function. The arguments are the values the parameters recieve.

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
The are functions that take other functions as arguments into their parameters or they return another function.
