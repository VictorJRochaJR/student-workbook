# What is Scope ?
Scope is where you are in the code, either locally or globally 


What is Hoisting ?
its where the function and declaration are moved to the top of the scope they are at.

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?
You would use var if you are using it globally or needing to redeclare the same variable over
You would use const if you need you will use a variable that you wont want reassigned or redeclared
You would use let if you only want it used within the block of code or "{}".
