What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.
 -console.log() is one way to write and you can use that one inside your code when you want to see if a certain function is working correctly.
 -the elements tab will also let you write and to the console, you could use that to see direct changes and erros without refreshing your page.
 -You can also use HTML by writing directly into your html.index. You would use this you want to see what your HTML is doing.
 -inner.html if you want to print and check something through javascript
Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?
-The elements page allows you to  see the breakdown, you can use it to see what is going on line by line.
Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?
-To insert break points in your code and check line by line and see where the code is breaking.
