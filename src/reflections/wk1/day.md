# What is Git and why do we use Git?
Git is open source/free to use. It allows us and other people to keep track of code and the version that is currently worked on. It keeps tracks of changes while also allowing multiple people to work on the same code. If there are any changes made it will notify you and others of what has changed and when the last change was made.
It also allows us and others to have backups incase anything ever happened to our computer or storage.
# What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Having multipe branches allows developers to work on a project simultaneously.
They are each able to have the code and work in parallel and make changes or make progress on it, when they are done they are also able to merge that branch back in to the Main branch.

 # What is the difference between Git and GitHub
The main difference is that Git is the system that allows you to make and track changes. It will create files that tracks what you tell it to track.
Github is the "hub" or a place that tracks and lets you put all your Git repositories in one place.
