# What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
My favorite tip that I found the most beneficial might have been creating spacing and seperation over borders so that the design  was still there but it looked less cluttered and busy.
# Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
 A few good resource that I think would be a big help to review good examples and get ideas were.
 <ul> 
  <li>material design guidlines for shadows.</li>
  <li>fontawesome and zondicon for certain icons, or even bootstrap icons</li>
  <li>dribbles color search to give me ideas on colors that go well together</li>
  </ul>


# How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
 I think a good designed website will also show how much you care about your business or idea of what the site is trying to convey as a whole.
 A good design will also help capture someones attention and keep it without overwhelming them or boring them at the same time.
