# What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
Wireframes have a few good purposes. They help get user ideas and opinions more honestly. It also helps creat a mock up process that can help define what sizes are correctly needed and define what features will need what.
They're also much cheaper to create because they're quicker to do and require close to no tools or expensive software. 

# What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
There are 3 different levels of wire-frames.
<ul>
<ul>The first is a low fidelity wire-frame. Which helps create a quick rough draft and give a general overall idea of what is wanted and needed. It uses simple images and block shapes</ul>
<ul>The second is medium-fidelty wire-frame. medium-fidelity is a bit more accurate then low-fidelity, it uses grey scale for color represantation and more detail is assigned to some components. These are usually created with a wire-framing tool</ul>
<ul>The 3rd type of wire-frame is called a high fidelity wire-frame. This one has more specific layouts even using pixels. Text will also become used in this wire-frame. Some boxes will have either an X for an image placeholder or an actual image. These are usually saved for the end of the mock up process.
Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
I think if properly used and even improperly used  wire-frames are worth the time and energy, because of the time and energy they save. You can start with a simple low-fidelity mock up to get feedback and not put in too much effort for things that you'll end up not needing. From there you can work your way up as you get more exact and specific in what the client would like in their site or project.
