# What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
A Psueo-Class is a special class you can add to selectors to change them in certain situations. I think the most common ones I will use, will be for situations like linking to an external site or to link directly to a phone number. Another one I believe will be common will be to use to open up Google Maps or an email from directly clicking on it.

# What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
Specificity is used to give value or weight and override the top to bottom order. It will help the browser decide on which style it should used based on the value of the selector.
# What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
I believe if you ever use the feature, you would run into problems  like conflicting style sheets and having the incorrect one used. It could also lead to more lazy and less specific code. You could also run into issues and have a harder time figuring out where your code went wrong.
