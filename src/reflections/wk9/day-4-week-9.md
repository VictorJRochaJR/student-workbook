# What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?
Enum adds an int or similar value to it.
Lets you use a word while still keeping an int value

# How can you modify an Enum?
You use the "=" to assign the value
# How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I havent used them yet but it could be useful when you want to make values easier to read
