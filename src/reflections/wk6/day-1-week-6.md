# What is Component based architecture?
You split up certain parts of a page or UI into smaller parts but they also show up on the same page. Even though they're on the same page or window, they interact seperately from each other.

# What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
You can have components act independently of each other and refresh on their own without affecting other components on the page. It also leads to better page speed and increased performance.
# What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
You can get long pages of code or it can  get messy when you start splitting so many things up that didnt need to be split up or independent of each other.
